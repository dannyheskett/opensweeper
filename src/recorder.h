// Frame-fidelity movie recorder. When active, every presented frame is read
// back from the fixed 640x480 canvas, converted to YUV, encoded as H.264
// (visually lossless), and muxed straight into an .mp4 at a constant 60 fps.
// There are no intermediate files: encoding is streamed as the game runs.
//
// Encoding each frame is synchronous, so while recording the game may run
// below real-time on slower machines; the resulting video is still exactly one
// frame per rendered frame.

// Start recording to `path`. If `path` is NULL/empty, an auto-named file
// "openblocks-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.mp4" is created in the working directory.
// Returns true on success. No-op (returns false) if already recording.
bool recorder_start(const char* path);

// Finalize the .mp4 and release resources. Safe to call when not recording.
void recorder_stop(void);

// Toggle recording on/off (auto-named file when turning on). Returns the new
// active state.
bool recorder_toggle(void);

// Read back the canvas and encode one frame. No-op when not recording.
