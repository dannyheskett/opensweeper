# Getting opensweeper into TestFlight

The release workflow already knows how to sign an `.ipa` and upload it to App
Store Connect. It does neither today because the secrets are absent — every
Apple step gates on them and reports "skipping". This is the one-time setup that
turns it on.

**You do not need a Mac.** The certificate is created with `openssl`, the
provisioning profile is downloaded from Apple's website, and the build, signing
and upload all happen on GitHub's macOS runners. That is the whole reason this
is automated.

**You do need a paid Apple Developer Program membership** ($99/year). A free
Apple ID can sideload to your own device but cannot use TestFlight.

Throughout: bundle ID is `com.danheskett.opensweeper`, and it must match
`ios/Info.plist` exactly.

**Already done this for another app on the same team?** The Apple Distribution
certificate (step 2) and the App Store Connect API key (step 5) are team-wide,
so the existing `.p12`, its password and the `.p8` can be reused as this repo's
secrets. Steps 1, 3 and 4 (App ID, provisioning profile, app record) are
per-app and must be done for opensweeper.

**Most of this is scripted.** `scripts/asc_setup.py` does steps 1 and 3 through
the App Store Connect API (App ID, then the App Store profile bound to the
certificate whose SHA-1 you pass), and after step 4 sets the category, content
rights, age rating, privacy policy URL and a free price. Step 4 (the app
record) and the App Privacy label have no API and stay in the console.

## 1. Register the App ID

[developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/account) → **Certificates,
Identifiers & Profiles** → **Identifiers** → **+**

- Type: **App IDs** → **App**
- Description: `opensweeper`
- Bundle ID: **Explicit** → `com.danheskett.opensweeper`
- Capabilities: leave everything off. The app uses none.

While you are here, note your **Team ID** (Membership Details, a 10-character
string like `A1B2C3D4E5`). That is `IOS_TEAM_ID`.

## 2. Create the distribution certificate (no Mac)

Generate a private key and a certificate signing request locally:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out ios_distribution.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ios_distribution.key -out ios_distribution.csr \
  -subj "/emailAddress=dan@danheskett.com/CN=Danny Heskett/C=US"
```

developer.apple.com → **Certificates** → **+** → **Apple Distribution**.

> ⚠️ It must be **Apple Distribution**, not the legacy "iOS Distribution
> (App Store and Ad Hoc)". The release workflow picks the signing identity with
> `awk '/Apple Distribution/'`, and the legacy certificate's common name starts
> with "iPhone Distribution" instead, so signing would fail to find an identity.

Upload `ios_distribution.csr`, download the resulting `distribution.cer`, then
bundle it with the private key into a `.p12`:

```sh
openssl x509 -in distribution.cer -inform DER -out distribution.pem -outform PEM
openssl pkcs12 -export \
  -inkey ios_distribution.key -in distribution.pem \
  -out distribution.p12 -name "Apple Distribution" \
  -passout pass:CHOOSE_A_PASSWORD
```

Keep `distribution.p12`, the password, and `ios_distribution.key` somewhere
safe and backed up. Generate them **outside the repo** — `~/apple-signing/` is
a good home. `.gitignore` covers `*.key`, `*.csr`, `*.cer`, `*.pem`, `*.p12` and
`*.p8` as a backstop, but the private key should never be inside the working
tree in the first place.

## 3. Create the App Store provisioning profile

developer.apple.com → **Profiles** → **+**

- Type: **App Store Connect** (under Distribution)
- App ID: `com.danheskett.opensweeper`
- Certificate: the Apple Distribution certificate from step 2

Download it as `profile.mobileprovision`.

## 4. Create the app record in App Store Connect

[appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) → **Apps** →
**+** → **New App**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | iOS |
| Name | `opensweeper` (see [LISTING.md](LISTING.md) for fallbacks if taken) |
| Primary Language | English (U.S.) |
| Bundle ID | `com.danheskett.opensweeper` |
| SKU | `opensweeper` |

This record must exist **before** the first upload: `altool` uploads *to* an
app, and `scripts/testflight_notes.py` looks the app up by bundle ID.

For TestFlight internal testing you do **not** need screenshots, a description,
or a privacy policy yet. Those are for submitting to the store — the copy is
ready in [LISTING.md](LISTING.md) when you get there.

## 5. Create an App Store Connect API key

App Store Connect → **Users and Access** → **Integrations** → **App Store
Connect API** → **+**

- Name: `opensweeper CI`
- Access: **App Manager**

Download `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8`. **Apple lets you download it exactly once.**
Note the **Key ID** (in the filename and the table) and the **Issuer ID** (shown
above the table, a UUID).

## 6. Set the seven repo secrets

Note the encodings — they are not all the same. The two binary files are
base64'd because a GitHub secret is text; the `.p8` is already text and is
stored raw, because the workflow writes it straight back out as a PEM file.

```sh
base64 -w0 distribution.p12        | gh secret set IOS_CERT_P12
gh secret set IOS_CERT_PASSWORD    -b 'CHOOSE_A_PASSWORD'        # from step 2
base64 -w0 profile.mobileprovision | gh secret set IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE
gh secret set IOS_TEAM_ID          -b 'A1B2C3D4E5'               # from step 1

gh secret set ASC_KEY_P8 < AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8                 # raw, NOT base64
gh secret set ASC_KEY_ID     -b 'XXXXXXXXXX'
gh secret set ASC_ISSUER_ID  -b '69a6de70-....-....-....-........'
```

(Or add them in the GitHub UI: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
New repository secret**.)

The two groups gate independently:

- `IOS_CERT_P12` + `IOS_CERT_PASSWORD` + `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` +
  `IOS_TEAM_ID` → `build-ios` produces a **signed** `.ipa` instead of an
  unsigned one.
- `ASC_KEY_P8` + `ASC_KEY_ID` + `ASC_ISSUER_ID` → `publish-testflight`
  validates and uploads it, and `testflight-notes` attaches the release notes.

All seven are needed end to end. Set only the first four and you get a signed
`.ipa` attached to the GitHub Release that you can upload by hand.

## 7. Cut a release

Merge to `main`, or run the **release** workflow manually with
`dry_run` **unchecked**. Then:

1. `build-ios` signs the `.ipa` and verifies it is App Store-shaped.
2. `publish` tags `release-N` and attaches the artifacts.
3. `publish-testflight` runs `altool --validate-app` first (its errors are far
   better than the upload path's) and then `--upload-app`.
4. Apple processes the build for 5–15 minutes.
5. `testflight-notes` polls until the build is `VALID`, then writes the commit
   message into "What to Test".

## 8. Add internal testers

App Store Connect → your app → **TestFlight** → **Internal Testing** → **+** on
Testers or Groups.

Internal testers must be Users on your App Store Connect account (up to 100).
**Internal testing needs no Beta App Review**, so builds are installable as soon
as processing finishes. External testers do need review — typically a day or
two, and only once per major version.

## What the repo already handles

These are the upload rejections that cost people the most time, and they are all
dealt with in `Makefile` and `scripts/gen_icons.py`:

| Problem | Handled by |
| --- | --- |
| ITMS-90713, missing top-level `CFBundleIconName` | `plutil -replace` after `actool` |
| App icon rejected for having an alpha channel | `gen_icons.py` flattens the iOS icon to RGB |
| "Built with a beta version of Xcode" | `DTXcode` / `DTXcodeBuild` / `DTSDK*` injected from the runner's toolchain |
| Export-compliance question on every upload | `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false` in `Info.plist` |
| "Build must be built with the iOS 26 SDK or later" | `build-ios` fails early with a clear message if the runner's SDK is older |
| `CFBundleVersion` must increase per upload | tracks the `release-N` number automatically |
| Missing `CFBundleSupportedPlatforms` | injected via `PlistBuddy` |

## Troubleshooting

**"no Apple Distribution identity found in the keychain"** — the certificate is
the legacy iOS Distribution type, or the `.p12` did not include the private key.
Redo step 2, making sure `openssl pkcs12 -export` got both `-inkey` and `-in`.

**"no app found for bundle id ..."** from `testflight-notes` — the App Store
Connect app record (step 4) does not exist, or its bundle ID does not match
`ios/Info.plist`.

**Upload rejected: "The provided entity includes an attribute with an invalid
value"** — usually a duplicate `CFBundleVersion`. Each upload needs a higher
number; cut a new release rather than re-running the old one.

**`publish-testflight` says "Skipping"** — one of the three `ASC_*` secrets is
missing, or the `.ipa` came out unsigned (so one of the four `IOS_*` secrets is
missing). The step prints which of the two conditions failed.
